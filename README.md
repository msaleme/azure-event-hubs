Anypoint Connector for Azure Event Hubs (Azure Event Hubs Connector) enables support for event producing and consuming.

Azure Event Hubs is a big data streaming platform and event ingestion service. It can receive and process millions of events per second. Data sent to an event hub can be transformed and stored by using any real-time analytics provider or batching/storage adapters.
The following examples show several Mule flows for Azure Event Hubs Connector:

Send a Single Event and Listen with EventHub Listener https://docs.mulesoft.com/azure-event-hubs-connector/latest/azure-event-hubs-connector-examples#publish-single-event
This Mule flow sends a single event to an Event Hub.

Publish a Batch of Events and Listen with Partition Listener https://docs.mulesoft.com/azure-event-hubs-connector/latest/azure-event-hubs-connector-examples#publish-bulk-event
This Mule flow sends multiple events simultaneously to an Event Hub.

Send Single Event with Content Type
This Mule flow sends a single event to an Event Hub with content type as JSON. https://docs.mulesoft.com/azure-event-hubs-connector/latest/azure-event-hubs-connector-examples#configure-json
